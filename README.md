# Social-media-js-2


As stated in my delivery note and what happened. I managed to get some of my data back trough apples back-up and have added a new folder with "my actual delivery" i got my data back on wednesday after 18 december so i don't if you will accept that, but i have atleast added it just so in case. The other files outsite the "my actual delivery" was delivered before deadline. I added the folder because then you can see that i have managed to use bootstrap and scss and done a little bit of javascript. I know that i have not managed any kind of a passing grade here, but feedback is always great i want to learn.
